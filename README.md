# 🪐 Asteroids Game – Python & Pygame

A classic-style space shooter game built with **Python** and **Pygame**.  
This project is part of the **Boot.dev** curriculum and serves as a hands-on exercise in object-oriented programming, game loops, and real-time user input handling.

## 🎮 Features

- Player-controlled spaceship with rotation and thrust
- Bullet firing mechanics
- Randomly spawning asteroids
- Collision detection between bullets, ship, and asteroids
- Score tracking and game-over logic

## 🧠 What I Learned

- How to use **Pygame** to create 2D games in Python
- How to implement game loops and frame updates
- Collision detection and basic physics
- Organizing a game project using **classes and modules**

## 🚀 Technologies Used

- Python 3.x
- Pygame
